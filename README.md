# Pantry Manager

# Overview
Have you ever went through a cabinet and thought "I have no idea any of this was in here"? Have you returned from the store with a new vanilla extract for your cookies only to find three more unopened vanilla extracts behind the empty flour bag (that you didn't buy a replacement of)? This program is designed to be a one stop "shop" for everything pantry related. Access your inventory, create shopping lists, and even analyze spending habits in one place.

# Plan of Attack
I had a million ideas swirling in my head regarding functions this app could or should do. My first step was to put pen to "paper" and draw out a rough plan (seen in the photo below). While it was by no means a comprehensive look, it gave me enough to start. I began many times at the top line - writing code for data storage, variables, etc., only to end in confusion. I decided to change my approach and thought "If I were a user signing on for the first time, what options would I like to have a available to me?" Through a simple, yet effective, input prompt, there was a path forward (and backward and left and right). The result here is the culmination of extensive trial and error, bad words, and discussion board browsing.
